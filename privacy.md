<h2>
At HomieBot, we believe that privacy is a fundamental human right and enshrine it as one of our core values.
</h2>

The data you share with us is an integral part of your life. 
HomieBot (“HomieBot”, "HomieBotUK", "Bonhomie Solutions", “we”) believes that the control of every experience you share with us and who you share it with, should be up to you. 
Everything we make is designed with a privacy and security-first approach, to protect your privacy and give you control over your information. 
Sometimes this takes time, sometimes we work for hours. But that’s the kind of innovation we strive for. Holding on to your private information is a 
serious responsibility, and we want you to know how we're handling it.

Thank you for trusting HomieBot with your personal information.

<h2>Control over what you share</h2>

We believe that you should have complete control over what you share with us. This is why we try to keep as little information mandatory as possible. However, the more you share with us, the more accurately our services can work for you. 

<h2>
How we keep your data secure
</h2>

HTTPS ensures that the entire user experience is safe from online threats. It provides authentication of the website’s identity, connection, and data integrity, and encrypts all information shared between the website and a user (including any cookies exchanged), protecting the data from unauthorized viewing, tampering, or mis-use.  This is visible as the padlock icon that appears in your web browser.

End-to-end encryption means that only you and the people you share data with can actually read it. It is a secure communication between you (one “end”) and a third party (the other “end”). It keeps eavesdroppers out of sight. Even if the data is somehow intercepted on the way from one “end” to another “end”, it will make no sense to the eavesdropper.

Significant portions of our services, sites,  APIs and applications are open-source. This allows for public trust, easy security auditing and collaboration.

<h2>
How we ensure your privacy
</h2>

When you use our services, you’re trusting us with all your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.

When you use HomieBot, we keep you confidential on our servers. A unique, randomly-generated identifier is created so your personal information, email and other information can stay private and encrypted.

We are fully compliant with the [Data Protection Act 2018 (United Kingdom)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted).

<h2>
Why we collect data
</h2>
## Increase engagement

When we collecting information, our brand ambassadors are interacting with and have more one-on-one face time with you. This increases the chances of us collaborating with city councils, finding better tenants, finding rehabilitation centers across the countryand so on...

## Improve our product

We love consumer insights, which are extremely difficult to get. Experiential marketing activations are a perfect way to get that valuable feedback on your products. Adding more form fields, asking consumers how they liked the product, if they would recommend your activation to a friend, and why they do or don't use your product. We also get consumer opinion of our company, and how we can change your perception of our brand?

## Understanding our audience

Understanding our audience is critical so we know who we're marketing to, and who is attending our activations. Collecting data will help us determine audience demographics, age groups, interests, and their knowledge of your brand.

<h2>
What data we collect
</h2>

<h2>
What we do with your data
</h2>

We perform data analytics by examining data sets in order to find trends and draw conclusions about the information they contain. This includes historical records or new information that have been processed for real-time analytics, from a mix of internal systems and external data sources.

Your data tells a story that guides our machine learning algorithms and nets as they extract the significant features, both in the training set and in the raw data they’ve been created to study. This ultimately makes HomieBot's suggestions and responses precise and relavant.

With our APIs, we securely provide information to certain third parties so that we can get you just the right information, at just the right time. This may include giving basic information to potential tenants or service providers and certain legal entities for a small fee to sustain our operations.
